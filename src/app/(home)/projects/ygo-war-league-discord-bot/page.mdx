## ‚ú® Inspiration

A Yu-Gi-Oh! Discord server was trying to create a war league for their community. It was in high demand from both members and admins to have a bot that can handle deck submissions and validation.

I offered to help them out and build out some low-hanging fruit features and was able to get it up and running before the first season in a span of a couple of days.

## üöÄ Features

- **Deck Submission:** Captains submit/update decks via Discord commands.
- **YDK Validation:** Ensures `.ydk` files match DuelingBook format.
- **Admin Controls:** Commands for league setup, submission management, and data viewing.
- **Automated Deck Images:** Generates deck image previews ([PIL](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)).
- **Local Storage:** Stores submissions and images locally (SQLite3 & file system).
- **Multi-Season/Week Support:** Manages league events across seasons/weeks.
- **Dockerized:** Simplified self-hosting with Docker.
- **Astro Starlight:** Documentation framework.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **discord.py:** Discord API wrapper for bot functionality.
- **PIL (Pillow):** Image processing for deck previews.
- **SQL/SQLAlchemy:** Database interaction and ORM.
- **Docker:** Containerization for deployment.
- **Astro Starlight:** Documentation framework.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tooling

- **uv:** Fast package manager.
- **Monorepo (uv workspaces):** Manages multiple projects.
- **mypy:** Static type checker.
- **ruff:** Linter and formatter.
