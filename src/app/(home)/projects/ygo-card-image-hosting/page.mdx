## ‚ú® Inspiration

One of the requirements for my [Yu-Gi-Oh! Discord Bot](/projects/ygo-war-league-discord-bot) is for the user to have a source of images for the deck previews.

The admin currently hosting this bot on their server wanted to migrate from hosting images on his own server to a separate service. Considering that timing, and my curiousity to use Terraform in a project, I decided to create this project to automate the scrape, archive, and hosting of Yu-GI-Oh! card images using AWS S3 and CloudFront.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated AWS Infrastructure:** Sets up AWS S3 for storage and CloudFront for content delivery using **Terraform**.
- **Configurable Downloads:** Allows users to customize which card images are downloaded based on **date ranges** and image **sizes**.
- **Dockerized:** Simplified self-hosting with Docker.
- **Astro Starlight:** Documentation framework.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **SQLite3:** Relational database for data storage.
- **SQLAlchemy:** ORM for database interaction.
- **Docker/Docker Compose:** Containerization and orchestration.
- **Terraform:** Infrastructure as Code for cloud provisioning.
- **AWS S3:** Object storage for archived images.
- **AWS CloudFront:** Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast image delivery.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tooling

- **uv:** Fast package manager.
- **mypy:** Static type checker.
- **ruff:** Linter and formatter.
