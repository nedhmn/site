## ‚ú® Inspiration

I built this personal website to aggregate my blogs, projects, work experience, and share a bit about myself.

A key requirement was easily adding new content via Markdown. My initial search for solutions like [Contentlayer](https://github.com/timlrx/contentlayer2) or existing templates were often overengineered or didn't fit the minimalist style I wanted.

Then I found [leerob's site](https://github.com/leerob/site). Its simple styling and use of [MDX](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/guides/mdx) was the perfect fit. This site shares a similar style, but I've expanded it with more features to showcase my blogs, projects, and work experience.
