## ‚ú® Inspiration

This website is a modern clone of [yugioh.party](https://web.archive.org/web/20250118113809/https://www.yugioh.party/), a hypergeometric calculator for Yu-Gi-Oh! card games.

It was inspired by the original website, which is no longer available. It was a very popular tool for players, including myself. The demand for a clone was high once the original got taken down, so I decided to create a modern version of it.
